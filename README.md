### Summary:

Exploratory Data Analysis project on covid-19 worldwide from February 2020 to February 2022.

### Objective:

- Analyze the percentage of the population that was infected in each country.
- Search for countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population.
- Identify the top countries with the highest death count per population.
- Identify monthly trends in global COVID-19 deaths.
- Find the cumulative monthly vaccination percentage as a proportion of the total population of each country, which allows us to assess the effectiveness of the vaccination efforts in each country.
- Find the global numbers of total cases, total deaths and death percentage.

### Findings:
